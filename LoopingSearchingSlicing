Looping Searching Slicing Assignment:

Part 1 - Write a program called “process_numbers.py” that repeatedly reads numbers input by the user 
until the user types “done”. After the user has entered “done”, print out (i.e. print) the total, 
count, maximum, minimum, and average of the entered numbers.  

Part 2 - Then, use the find() method and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon 
character and then use the float() function to convert the extracted string into a floating 
point value.

Part 1:

sum = 0
count = 0
maximum = 0
minimum = 0
average = 0

while True:
    try:
        x = input('Enter a number: ')
        if (x == 'Done'):
            break
        value = float(x)
        sum = value + sum
        count = count + 1
        average = count/sum
        maximum = x[0]
        for x in [x]:
            if x > maximum:
                maximum = x
        minimum = x[0]
        for x in [x]:
            if x < minimum:
                minimum = x
    except:
        print('Invalid input')
print(sum, count, maximum, minimum, average)

#%%

Part 2:

string = avg_str = 'Average value read: 0.72903'
atpos = string.find(':')
num = string[atpos+1:].strip()
print (num)
