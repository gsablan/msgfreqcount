# Message Frequency Count Assignment 

#Using the DSU pattern, write a program that reads through the mail box data and when you find a line that starts with “From”, extract the 
address information from the line. Count the number of messages from each person by using a dictionary. After all of the data has been read, print (i.e., print) a message to 
the user stating that the person with the highest number of sent messages is <email_address>, along with the number of sent messages associated with that email address (e.g., 
“with n messages”).

dict_addresses = dict() 
lst = list()

fname = input('Please enter the file name:') 
try: 
    fhand = open(fname) 
except: 
    print('File name does not exist:', fname) 
    exit()

for line in fhand: 
    words = line.split() 
    if len(words) < 2 or words[0] != 'From': 
        continue 
    else: 
        if words[1] not in dict_addresses: 
            dict_addresses[words[1]] = 1 
        else: 
            dict_addresses[words[1]] += 1

for key, val in list(dict_addresses.items()): 
    lst.append((val, key))

lst.sort(reverse=True) 
for key, val in lst[:1]:

    max_lst = (val, key) 
(e1, e2) = max_lst

print(('The email address with the most sent messages was'), (e1), ('with'), (e2))
