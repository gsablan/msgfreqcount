Message Frequency Count Assignment
Using the DSU pattern, write a program that reads through the mail box data and when you find a line that starts with “From”, extract the address information from the line. Count the number of messages from each person by using a dictionary. After all of the data has been read, print (i.e., print) a message to the user stating that the person with the highest number of sent messages is <email_address>, along with the number of sent messages associated with that email address (e.g., “with n messages”).
